# Project #1: Tic Tac Toe

### Due Date

Project presentations will be on Friday (Dec 23).

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - a game!

We'll be making Tic Tac Toe, a game that takes seconds to learn but minutes to master! Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development. 

You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
- Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
- Craft a ``README.md`` file that explains your app to the world

---

### Technical Requirements

Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won or show a draw if neither player wins
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Follow the DRY (Dont' Repeat Yourself) principle
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages where the rest of the world can access it

---

### Necessary Deliverables

- A working game, built by you, hosted on GitHub Pages.
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, links to or embedded screenshots of the planning process, installation instructions (if any), unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.
- At least one artifact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe demonstrating planning embedded in the `README.md`.

### Stretch Goals

These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
- Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations
- Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh
- Implement a reset button that resets the game without refreshing the whole page
- Involve Audio in your game
- Implement a turn timer so that if a player takes too long without making a move, a random move is made for them
- Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
- Add a simple AI to support one player vs computer mode. In this case, "simple" just means having the computer pick a random empty square.
- Add a better, unbeatable AI.
- Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist!

### Project Presentation

Demo your game to the class and then answer some or all of these questions:

- What features did you include?
  - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
- What was the most difficult part of the project?
- What was your favourite part to work on?
- What would you like to add next?

Be ready to field some additional questions.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.
- Wireframe the design of your game (draw out sketches of what your game will look like at different stages. Planning the design ahead of time removes the burden of designing as you code)
- Write pseudocode. Start by stating the problems in plain text. This will help you guide your process and understand the problem better.
- Use your Developer Tools (`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
    - Some great tutorials for the Developer Tools can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
- Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
